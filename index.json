GRYD uses a questionnaire (\u0026lsquo;Youth Services Eligibility Tool\u0026rsquo;, or YSET) to evaluate the eligibility of students for this program. Students are sorted into three categories: low risk, at risk, and high risk. The program aims to provide resources for the at risk group.\nThe dataset contains the responses of $N \\sim 10,000$ students. The questionnaire has $100$ questions, of which only $56$ are used for risk assessment. To calculate risk factor, a student\u0026rsquo;s score is calculated using nine thematic scales. A student scoring in less than three of the scales is considered to have low risk factor, and a student scoring in more than five of the scales is considered to have high risk factor.\nThere may be other methods that are more effective at classifying students into three groups. It is important to be able to visualize our data in order to identify features of our dataset and to be able to compare different methods. If each response can be thought of as a point in real coordinate space, we should investigate projecting the space onto two dimensions without loss of information.\nPrinciple Component Analysis The first method to try is linear dimensionality reduction using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). PCA linearly projects the data onto the directions in which the sample variance is maximized.\nInstead of doing analysis directly, I used the graph Laplacian $L$ on either the scales or the questions. Considering that there are nine scales and $56$ questions, a response $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$ or $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{56}$, respectively. The dataset can be written as a graph with nodes $x_i$ and weighted edges $w_{ij}$ corresponding to the similarity in answering the questionnaire. The weights $w_{ij}$ correspond to a Gaussian distribution, scaled according to the Euclidean distance between responses $x_i$ and $x_j$ and a parameter $\\sigma$. Then the corresponding graph Laplacian $L = D - W$, where:\n\\begin{aligned} W_{ij} \u0026amp;= e^{\\frac{-\\Vert x_i - x_j \\Vert^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\\\\nD \u0026amp;= \\text{diag}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^m W_{ij}\\right) \\end{aligned} The graph Laplacian is positive semidefinite, meaning we can decompose it into eigenvalues $\\lambda_i \\geq 0$ such that $Lv_i = \\lambda_i v_i$.\nPCA works as follows. Let $\\mathbf{V} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be the subspace spanned by the basis of the first two unit eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of $L_{d\\times d}$, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. Then we can project a point $x$ onto $\\mathbf{V}$: $$\\hat{x} = \\text{proj}_\\mathbf{V}(x) = \\bar{x} + \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\langle x - \\bar{x}, u_i\\rangle u_i$$ where $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean. The error using least squares is $$\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\Vert \\hat{x_n} - \\bar{x}\\Vert^2 = \\sum_{j=3}^d \\lambda_j$$ so the projection minimizes the error by taking the largest two eigenvalues.\nFigure 1 shows the results of PCA on the scales. The responses are clearly clustered into three groups, however these three groups do not correspond to Risk Factor (RF). Upon further investigation, they are clustered according to a scale that only has two questions. Thus, this result reflects a property of the questionnaire\u0026rsquo;s construction which is not meaningful.\n\rFigure 1: Principle Component Analysis on the scales of the dataset. The numbers on the $x$ and $y$ axis represent the explained variance corresponding to the top two eigenvectors. $49.34\\%$ of the data is captured by the first eigenvector in dimensionality reduction.\r\r Figure 2 shows the results of PCA on the questions. There is one large cluster with a clear progression from low Risk Factor to high Risk Factor, but there is significant overlap.\n\rFigure 2: Principle Component Analysis on the questions. Just like in Figure 1, the numbers on the $x$ and $y$ axis represent the explained variance corresponding to the top two eigenvectors.\r\r Different distance metrics in the weight calculation of the graph Laplacian may yield more desirable results. However, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach is far more important.\nNonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that extends metric multidimensional distances (MDS). The algorithm has three steps. First, it performs $k$-nearest neighbors to identify the contour of the manifold. Second, it estimates the geodesic distances by calculating the shortest paths between points. Finally, Isomap performs MDS on the new distance matrix.\nAdditionally, Isomap is isometric, meaning that the mapping between manifolds preserves distances between points. Since we want to understand how different responses relate to each other, this is crutial. In the 2018 UCLA REU, Yifan Li worked on a methodology for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.\nDynamic Mode Decomposition In the summer of 2018, I studied the GRYD dataset as a dynamical system using Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Jiazhong Mei and Qinyi Zeng. Please see the publication below. In January 2019 I will apply the methodology to students who were rejected from the program and analyze new data from GRYD.\n","date":1554421196,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554421196,"objectID":"f01dd647ee0963a27f30ac49ac65c454","permalink":"https://avivaprins.com/project/gryd/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T16:39:56-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/gryd/","section":"project","summary":"Research for the GRYD program in Los Angeles","tags":["Research","Machine Learning","Dynamical Systems","Python","active"],"title":"Gang Reduction and Youth Development","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yifan Li","Jiazhong Mei","Aviva Prins","Qinyi Zeng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533106800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533106800,"objectID":"2bbb9ae7480bc49703a9aabb59e3a4aa","permalink":"https://avivaprins.com/publication/gryd-dmd/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gryd-dmd/","section":"publication","summary":"We are interested in studying the effectiveness of the Gang Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD)'s prevention program by analyzing the change in estimated risk factor at different time steps.

The former mixture consists of two negatively buoyant particle species with the same diameter and different densities, while the latter slurry consists of a single negatively buoyant species of particle but with two distinct diameters.

We develop theoretical models and simulations to compare against our experimental results, as well as produce a phase diagram for constant flux bidensity that can predict the long term regimes of slurries. Additionally, we observe an unexpected settling phenomenon in the bidisperse experiments where long term particle front order is the opposite of what we expect. At first, the large particles settle out of the flow, however we observe that with enough time, the larger particle front migrates in front of the smaller particle front, indicating that the larger particles do not completely sink.","tags":[],"title":"Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Bidisperse Particle-Laden Flows on an Incline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aviva Prins"],"categories":null,"content":" Introduction A slurry is a mixture of solid particles and liquid. I studied an aspect of slurries called viscous particle laden flow in Dr. Bertozzi\u0026rsquo;s Applied Math Lab in 2016 and 2017 with other undergraduate students. We used simulations and experiments to study the effects of gravitational and shear forces on bidisperse slurries. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to highlight some of our findings on bidensity slurries in this article.\nThe behavior of these flows are important because they occur in many fields. Mining companies use spiral separators to separate minerals from ore. Mixtures of oil, sand, and water occur in oil spills. Slurries also occur in industrial, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts.\n\rFigure 1: Bidisperse slurries are any slurry with two types of particles present, such as this bidensity slurry. To study how gravity and shear force affect the flow, we use an incline with variable angle $\\alpha$. Since the height of the slurry $h$ is small relative to the length of the incline, this is called a thin-film flow.\r\r When the mixture flows down a ramp, some interesting behavior occurs. Sometimes the particles separate from the liquid. Sometimes the particles move faster than the liquid, forming a particle-rich ridge at the front of the flow. Sometimes fingers form. We wanted to create a mathematical model to describe the fluid’s dynamics that depends on external forces and the types and quantity of particles present in the slurry.\nFigure 2: Two regimes emerge as the slurry flows down the incline, depending on the dominating force. Gravity dominates in the settled regime, so the particles sink out of the flow. In this case, the heavier particles settle first, followed by the lighter particles, leaving a clear fluid front. In the ridged regime, the shear force dominates, creating a particle-rich front.\r\r  Previous research123 has developed a force-based model for constant volume monodisperse flow. Lee et. al.4 and Wong and Bertozzi5 extended this model to the bidensity case using experiments and theory, respectively. They used constant volume initial conditions, meaning that a fixed volume of slurry was poured onto the incline and allowed to flow. We adapted their model to use constant flux initial conditions, where the slurry is continuously added to the incline with a constant flow rate. We also performed experiments using the same total volume fraction $\\phi_0 = \\frac{V_p}{V_t} = 0.4$ parameter, and compared the results to the prediction of the theory.\nTheory Using the Navier-Stokes equation and particle mass conservation, we can create a system of coupled ODEs. Let $\\phi_i$, $i=1,2$ to be the volume fraction of particle $i$ to the total volume, $\\phi = \\phi_1 + \\phi_2$, and the $\\boldsymbol{J}_i$ term is the flux of particle $i$: \\begin{aligned} 0 \u0026amp;= \\nabla \\cdot (-pI + \\mu(\\nabla\\boldsymbol{u} + \\nabla\\boldsymbol{u}^T)) + \\rho\\boldsymbol{g}. \\\\\n0 \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\phi_i}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_i + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_i, \\quad i=1,2. \\end{aligned} Assuming equilibrium in the $z$-direction, the resulting system of ODEs relates the dervitives of the shear stress $\\sigma$, viscosity $\\mu$, and density $\\rho$.\nTo model the height and front position of the fluid and two particles, we introduce depth-averaged particle concentration and volume ratio. Then we have a system of PDEs: \\begin{aligned} 0 \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(h^3f(\\bar{\\phi},\\bar{\\chi})) \\\\\n0 \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial (h\\bar{\\phi_i})}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(h^3g_i(\\bar{\\phi},\\bar{\\chi})), \\quad i=1,2 \\end{aligned}\nWe consider the Riemann initial condition: \\begin{aligned} h(x,0) \u0026amp;= \\begin{cases} \\left[\\frac{3\\mu(\\phi_0)Q}{W\\rho(\\phi_0)g\\sin\\alpha}\\right]^\\frac{1}{3}, \u0026amp; x0 \\end{cases} \\\\\n\\bar{\\phi}(x,0) \u0026amp;= \\begin{cases} \\phi_0, \u0026amp; x0 \\end{cases} \\\\\n\\bar{\\chi}(x,0) \u0026amp;= \\begin{cases} \\chi_0, \u0026amp; x0 \\end{cases} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\nFinally, expressing the system in vector notation we have: \\begin{equation} U = (h, h\\bar{\\phi_1},h\\bar{\\phi_2})^T \\\\\nF(U) = h^3(f,g_1,g_2)^T \\end{equation} $$U_t + (F(U))_x = 0$$\nWe then solve the partial differential equation using an upwind scheme. The height profile can be obtained from $h$ and the particle front profile can be found from plotting the concentration profile.\nExperiments We can perform experiments to track the particle fronts and height profile of the particle laden flow. We can vary the total volume fraction $\\phi_0$, the volume ratio between beads $\\chi$, and the inclination angle $\\alpha$ of the track. In addition, we can have two types of initial conditions: constant volume or constant flux. In the constant volume case we measure and pour a finite volume onto the track. In the constant flux case, we use a pump to continuously add slurry to the track. A picture of the track is below.\n\rFigure 3: A picture of our adjustable incline. The track is clear with a green screen behind it. The white peristaltic pump on the left is used for constant flux experiments.\r\r In 2017, we used the following materials:\n   Particles density $\\rho$ diameter $d$ color     Small Glass (P1) $2.5$ g/cm$^3$ $0.07-0.125$ mm pink (dyed)   Small Ceramic (P2) $3.8$ g/cm$^3$ $0.150-0.180$ mm blue (dyed)   Large Glass (P3) $2.5$ g/cm$^3$ $0.40-0.60$ mm white   Large Ceramic (P4) $3.8$ g/cm$^3$ $0.40-0.60$ mm red   Fluid density $\\rho$ viscosity $\\nu$ color   PDMS oil $0.971$ g/cm$^3$ $10^{-3}$ m$^2$/s clear    The liquid used in all experiments is viscous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil. For bidensity experiments, we use glass and ceramic beads with the same diameter (P3 and P4). For bidisperse experiments, we use pairs of beads with the same density but different diameters (P1 and P3, or P2 and P4).\nWe film the slurry as it flows down the track to capture front position and velocity information. Using MATLAB, we can analyze the concentrations of particles present in different segments of the flow. We identify the front position of each species of particle and the PDMS.\nTo create a height profile of the flow, we use a laser sheet and analyze video in MATLAB. As shown in Figure 4, the laser line position in the video is distorted by the slurry.\n\rFigure 4: One frame from a height profile experiment. As the particle laden flow moves down the incline, it distorts the location of the laser line in the video.\r\r Experimental Results The constant flux bidensity experiments from 2017 are summarized in Figure 5. As the phase diagram shows, we experimentally see the ridged regime at trials displayed by the blue diamonds, the settled regime at trials displayed by black circles, and the well-mixed regime at trials displayed by red circles.The darker shaded region on the table shows where we expect to see more ridged regimes, and the white area is where we expect to see settled regimes. The light gray region in between our ridged and settled experiments is where we see the transient well-mixed regime. \rFigure 5: Markers specify experimental trials. Shading indicates the ridged (dark grey), well-mixed (light grey), and settled (white) regimes. The theory suggests that eventually, the boundary between settled and ridged regimes is the dotted line.\r\r\nNumerical Results Figures 5 and 6 compare the simulation and experimental results for front position and height profile. In the settled regime, there are three distinct lines in both simulation and experiment corresponding to the three fronts. Although they do not align perfectly, we can see that qualitatively, the fluid and the lighter particles are behaving similarly to simulation, as they are moving with similar velocity. In the ridged regime, the simulated front positions coincide with the experimental results.\nFigure 5: Front position for the settled regime (left) and ridged regime (right). Black is the fluid front, red is the lighter particle front, and blue is the heavier particle front.\r\r  In the settled regime, the height profile for the experimental data and theoretical data correspond to each other well, except that the real height is about 1mm higher than predicted. In the ridged regime, again the shape of the graphs from experiment and simulation agrees with each other. But in the simulation, the spike at the slurry front will keep increasing in height as time goes on. This unrealistic behavior depends on the precursor height for the simulation. In this particular example, the precursor height is set to be 1% of the initial height of the slurry. Higher precursor height will prevent this behavior. If the precursor height is set to be 35% or higher, then the front will not keep getting higher forever.\nFigure 6: Height profile for the settled (left) and ridged (right) regimes.\r\r  Discussion We found that the behavior of constant flux bidensity flow is similar to the behavior of constant volume bidensity flow studied in previous work 45. Experimentally, we determine the time required for a regime to emerge, and the critical angle at which the transition between settled and ridged regimes occurs. In addition, we implement a theoretical model that shows the same results. The comparison between the theory and experiment shows good agreement, especially in the ridged regime. Unlike in previous work, the front position grows linearly with time because of the constant flux initial condition.\nFuture Work The current model predicts the ridge to grow arbitrarily large in height as time goes on. Further research could look into mitigating this behavior by including a precursor height, i.e. a thickness of the fluid that is already present on the incline before the front reaches it. It may also be useful to look into improving the experimental technique used to measure the height profile to reduce noise. Our model may also be modified to investigate other types of slurries, such as with different size particles.\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to all the undergraduate and graduate students I worked with.

Low values of $\\alpha$ and $\\phi$ are correlated with the settled regime, and high values with the ridged regime.

Experiments are done to obtain height profiles, front positions, surface velocities and observe different regimes. The model gives qualitative predictions of the separation of regimes and the linear dependence on time of the front positions. One important observation is that the timescales for the regimes to occur are longer than the finite volume case.","tags":[],"title":"Constant Flux Particle-laden Viscous Thin Film Flows on an Incline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aviva Prins"],"categories":[],"content":"The Los Angeles Audubon’s environmental education program at Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area educates local students about the outdoors.

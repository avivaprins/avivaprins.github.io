      <description>The Gang Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD) program in Los Angeles has a program for adolescents at risk of joining gangs. GRYD uses a questionnaire (&amp;lsquo;Youth Services Eligibility Tool&amp;rsquo;, or YSET) to evaluate the eligibility of students for this program. Students are sorted into three categories: low risk, at risk, and high risk. The program aims to provide resources for the at risk group.
The dataset contains the responses of $N \sim 10,000$ students.</description>

      <description>One of the most commonly used tools in public policy and social sciences are surveys. In the absence of directly observable actions, self-reported surveys become indispensable in identifying and classifying high-risk individuals. One such survey, which identifies individuals under financial duress, is the subject of our project.
Using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a supervised machine learning method, we investigate whether indirect information from our survey dataset determines a respondent&amp;rsquo;s financial well-being.</description>
